          Thank you for checking out MadeupbyMaria. I've been a makeup
          enthusiast since I was a little girl and luckily was able to make a
          career out of it.
          <br />
          <br />
          I completed the beauty makeup course at London Eyes Inc.
          International Academy of Makeup along with their Airbrush Master
          Class. In an effort to keep up with the latest techniques, I recently
          had the ultimate experience to attend the celebrity makeup artist,
          Mario Dedivanovic, Master Class. He has made up countless celebrities
          such as Kim Kardashian West, Selma Hayek, Kate Bosworth, Bebe Rexha,
          Demi Lovato and many more.
          <br />
          <br />
          I specialize in event make up including weddings and proms and
          would love to make you feel your best on your special day. Please
          email me so you too can be MadeupbyMaria.
